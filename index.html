			<h2>Magazine Management System</h2>
			<p>The Online Magazine Management System has two stoner places away from the public/callers. The two stoner places are the director and the Author/ Registered stoner. These stoner places are participating the same Front- End Panel to manage the data in the system. The Admin who have access to all features and functionalities of the system while the Author/ Registered users can only manage the data of the magazine they created. When the author submits an composition about a certain magazine, the composition will be saved but not published to the public at first. The admin is in charge of vindicating the papers if whether the composition should be published or not. This operation has a comment section that allows the callers and public to leave a communication or feedback on each magazine's composition. The comment section also works like the magazines whereas the submitted commentary of non-registered users needs an admin verification. Talking about the magazine details, the author can upload magazine cover images, add content/ description, and upload a pdf train of the magazine. </p>
